# MJ-VRC-Prefabs
This is a compilation of Prefabs I've made

# OSC macro

Just add the OSC menu to your avatar
and add the int paramiter "OSCOut"


# Night Detector
Add the Bool "IsNight" to your avatar, and map it to what you want to change in your avatar in your animator
If you run the script 1000 times in a day it will fall back on 7am, 7pm for detection.
